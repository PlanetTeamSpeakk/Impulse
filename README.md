# Impulse
Source code of the Impulse Discord bot.

## Dependencies
If you want to run a version higher than or equal to 1.8 of this bot on Linux you're gonna have to install GTK+, it took me a solid 4 hours to install that so you may want to rethink running this bot on Linux. You can see how to install GTK+ [right here](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-building.html), don't forget the dependencies, and you can download GTK+ [right here](https://www.gtk.org/download/linux.php).
